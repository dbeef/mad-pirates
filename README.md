### What is this repository for? ###

This is Mad Pirates game repository. 
For now (8th of May 2016) the game is in its very infancy, assets are 100% open game art and I foresee it will take some time to build what I want (android/PC sandbox 2D pirate game).

Version: I can't really call it a game right now.
